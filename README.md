# BoredLight (Fork of VarLight)

Updated fork of [VarLight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/varlight) for **1.16.5**.

**P.S.** In respect to the original author, I will stop supporting this mod, if and when, the original author starts updating his mod again.

## Description

BoredLight allows you to create custom Light sources by right clicking blocks with glowstone dust.

-   Right click blocks with glowstone dust to increment Light Level by 1
-   Left click blocks with glowstone dust to decrement Light level by 1
-   Breaking Custom Light sources with a Silk touch tool will drop a glowing version of the block

**Supported MC Versions:**

-   1.16.5

## Commands

-   `/varlight update`: Update the light level at a given position (Syntax: `/varlight update <pos> <light level>`)
-   `/varlight fill`: Fill an entire region with Light sources (Syntax: `/varlight fill <pos 1> <pos 2> <light level> [include|exclude] [include filter|exclude filter]`)
-   `/varlight give`: Like the vanilla `/give` command, but receive a glowing version of the block instead
-   `/varlight debug`: List custom light sources
-   `/varlight stepsize`: Use any interval from 1-15 instead of 1 per click (Syntax: `/varlight stepsize <1-15>`)
